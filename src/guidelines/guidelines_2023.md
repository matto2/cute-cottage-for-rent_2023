* Let me know asap if anything in house needs attention, questions, emergencies, etc... 
* Fire extinguisher is under the sink
* Major water leaks—->Water turn off in front of the house - under faucet - very close to the ground. 
* If you smell gas—-> Turn off gas at shut-off and/or meter on front corner of house with wrench. Matt to provide wrench and instructions. ![turn-off-gas](/assets/img/wrench.png)
